I’ve been reading a lot of [usesthis.com] lately, I find
it very interesting reading about the computing setup, hardware and
software, used by other people. The people interviewed by this site are
more or less famous people in several professions like entrepreneurs,
coders, designers, photographers, etc. In the spirit of this website, I
write this post about the setup I use.

<img src="/assets/images/setup.jpg" title="Picture of my setup" class="center" alt="Picture of my setup" />

I currently use a 15" Macbook Pro with a 2.2GHz quad core Intel Core i7,
8GB of ram, and a 750GB SATA hard drive, I didn’t go for an SSD right
now because I need copious amounts of hard disk space.

I run OS X Snow Leopard with [MacPorts], Mail.app for
my personal mail, [Things] for my to-do list needs
(although I am flirting with the idea of switching to [Org Mode],
[iTerm 2] as a Terminal.app replacement. For
communications I use [Skype], [Adium], and
[Twitter for Mac].

For programming I use [GNU Emacs] as text editor and IDE, I
keep my [customization] on GitHub, I use
[git] for source code management.

I use [VMWare Fusion] to run [Windows 7], [Visual Studio 2008] using its
[Emacs Keyboard Scheme], and [SQL Server 2008 R2], I use this virtual machine to perform my
development work for [INgrooves].

I use several utilities like [Alfred], I like being able
to open apps quickly without using the mouse (I remove every app from
the Dock), [RightZoom] to maximize applications to
use the whole desktop, [TinyGrab] to take and share
screenshots, [Caffeine] which allows me to keep my Mac
awake when I leave it idle for a while, [Dropbox] is a
must have for file sharing and syncing.

I also have an iPhone 3GS which I use a lot for email and twitter and an
iPad I use for reading ebooks from Amazon, I actually wish I had chosen
a Kindle.
